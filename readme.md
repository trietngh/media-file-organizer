# MEDIA FILES ORGANIZER
## DESCRIPTION
**Media-Files-Organizer** is a Python program to **organize a various media file types** by renaming files based on **capture date/creation date** found in file's metadata.

Image metadata is extracting by using [PIL](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow) librairy.
Video metadata is extracting by using [Hachoir](https://hachoir.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) librairy.

All contributions to this project is welcome.

## CAUTION

1. For safety, please make sure to **_backup your important files_** before put it in the program. 
This program is tested by me, but I will not be responsible for any file lost or corrupted due to undiscovered bugs.

2. **_Uncorrected naming may occured_** because the capture/creation date in file's metadata may refer to the date it is been create in the current working directory.
